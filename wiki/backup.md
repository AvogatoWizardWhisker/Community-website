# Backing up data

## What do you need to back up?

It mostly depends on your preference, but you can start with your personal documents, photos, videos, and any other data on your computer, these should be backed up regularly, in case you lost them.

Your settings, programs, system files could be backed up, but you don't have to back them up because these are usually not important.

## Why do I need to back up my files?

Some updates, software bugs or malware could delete your data, your computer's drive could fail at some point, taking backups is useful when you regularly modify system files, or when you format your disks frequently.

## Backup locally

### Using an external drive

If you have an external drive, you could use it to backup your files by transferring your files to it or using a backup solution. Your external drive could include a backup software made by the drive's manufacturer, you can use that to back up your files.

### Using File History (Windows 10)

You can use File History to restore your files in case the original ones are damaged, lost or deleted.

- Open Settings.
- Go to Update & Security > Backup.
- Add a drive to File History.

### Using System Image Backup

You can use System Image Backup to back up your system image.

- Search "File History" or go to Settings > Update & Security > Backup and click on "Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" (Windows 10).
- On the Control Panel sidebar, click on "Create a system image".
- Choose where to save the backup.

## Backup to a cloud service

You can also back up your data on a cloud service (for example: OneDrive, Google Drive etc...), this solution could be better in case you lost your backup drive.

### OneDrive

You can use OneDrive to back up your data, but it offers only 5GB storage for free so it might not be sufficient for your needs, if you need more storage though, you could use Microsoft 365 or pay for more storage, anyways you can do it as follows:

- If you have OneDrive installed (it comes preinstalled by default on a clean install), you can continue with the below steps. If not, download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/download) and sign in with your account.
- Click the OneDrive icon in your system tray, that will open a panel.
- Click on the gear icon (Help & Settings) then click on Settings to open settings.
- Switch to the "Backup" tab and click on "Manage backup". This will open a new window where you can choose to back up your desktop, documents, and/or pictures folders.
- Click on "Start Backup" to run a backup. After this completes, OneDrive will continue to back up files in your chosen folders.

You will find your backed up files in your user folder (C:\Users\\[your user name here]\OneDrive) or on the website if you need the files later.

### Google Drive

You can also use Google Drive to back up your files and it offers 15GB of storage which is more than what OneDrive offers, anyways you can install and use Drive for Desktop as follows:

- [Download Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) if you didn't install it.
- After installing, open Drive for Desktop.
- Click on "Add folder" to start syncing the folder.

You can use the [website](https://drive.google.com) to view your files after syncing, or on the file explorer.
