You probably heard about countless ways to backup your data, but which one of them is the right one? And what do you need to back up?

## What do you need to back up?

It mostly depends on your preference, but you can:

- Start with your personal documents, photos, videos, and any other data on your computer, these should be backed up regularly, in case you lost them.

Your settings, programs could be backed up, but you don't have to back them up.

## Backup locally

### Using an external drive

If you have an external drive, you could use it to backup your files by transferring your files to it or using a backup solution.
