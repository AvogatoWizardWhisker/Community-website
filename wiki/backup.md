# Backing up data

## What do you need to back up?

It mostly depends on your preference, but you can start with your personal documents, photos, videos, and any other data on your computer, these should be backed up regularly, in case you lost them.

## Why do I need to back up my files?

Some updates, software bugs or malware could delete your data, your computer's drive could fail at some point, taking backups is useful when you regularly modify system files or when you format your disks frequently.

## Backup locally

### Using an external drive

If you have an external drive, you could use it to backup your files by transferring your files to it or using a backup solution. Your external drive could include a backup software made by the drive's manufacturer, you can use that to back up your files.

### Using File History (Windows 10)

File History is a tool which automatically makes backups of your files. You can keep track of each file's revision by using the Previous Versions tab in a file's properties window or by right clicking on a file then selecting "Restore previous versions", and you can also choose when to back up files and when to remove the backups.

You can use File History as follows:

- Open Settings.
- Go to Update & Security > Backup.
- Add a drive to File History in order to use as a backup drive.

### Using System Image Backup

You can use System Image Backup to back up your system image. A system image is basically an image of the current state of the operating system stored in a file. You can use these system images to revert the system to a previous state.

- Search "File History" or go to Settings > Update & Security > Backup and click on "Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" (Windows 10).
